# Sales-forecasting-project-with-machine-learning
**Project Description**
This application is a Sales Prediction App that leverages machine learning to analyze user-provided data, build a predictive model, and provide insights through an interactive graphical interface. The main features of the application are:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load CSV files and handle missing values.
Extract date-related features and convert categorical variables to a machine-learning-friendly format.
Machine Learning Modeling:

Support for three model types: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE and RMSE.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Simple interface for loading data, selecting models, and visualizing predictions and charts.

**Requirements**
Python Libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
tkinter

**How to Run**
Load a dataset (CSV format).
Select a machine learning model.
Execute predictions and view the results in charts.

**Code Structure**
Load and Preprocess Data: Handles data loading and initial preprocessing.
Model Training: Trains the selected model with the provided data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using numerical metrics and visualization.
GUI: Interactive interface for user interaction with the program.

**Future Improvements**
Support for additional data formats like Excel files.
Option to save trained models for later use.
Enhanced visualizations in the graphical interface.
Integration of more advanced models such as neural networks.
